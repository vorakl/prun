Contribution Details
====================

All contributions are welcome and appreciated!

Requirements
------------

There are basically only a few requirements for your contributions
to be accepted: 
 * Verification that you are really who you say you are. This is done
 by signing all git commits with the GnuPG key associated with the committer's
 email (`git commit -S ...`)
 * Sign of the [Developer Certificate of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)
 to certify that you wrote the code, or otherwise have the right to submit
 the code. This is done by adding the `Signed-off-by` line to a commit message
 (`git commit -s ...`)
* One commit per Pull-Request, rebased on top of the main branch.
This is needed to maintain a linear git history and usually done
by force-pushing (`git push -f ...`) any requested changes to your commit.
